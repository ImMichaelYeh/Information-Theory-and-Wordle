    "To complete the final project successfully, please follow these steps.\n",
    "- Check the stream \"Quiz/final project Q&A\" for the topic \"Final project topics and groups\".\n",
    "   - In most cases, you should be assigned the topic that you indicated on the Google Form as your first choice. A handful of students may be assigned their second choice instead.\n",
    "   - You have also been assigned randomly to a group of 2 or 3 in which all of you are presenting *different* topics (this being the reason why not too many people can choose the same topic).\n",
    "   - I am planning a future lecture about the topic assignment process, which uses pandas in an essential way.\n",
    "- Prepare two Jupyter notebooks called \"presentation1-xxx.ipynb\" and \"presentation2-xxx.ipynb\" where xxx is your UCSD email address (without the `@ucsd.edu` part).\n",
    "   - Your notebooks should be in the style of a lecture of this course. In particular, together they should take 45-50 minutes to present, spending at least 15 minutes on each notebook.\n",
    "   - One of your notebooks should use the Julia 1.6 or 1.7 kernel; the other should use the Python 3 or SageMath 9.4 kernel. (You are free to choose the order of these two.)\n",
    "   - Your notebooks may depend on packages not available in CoCalc. However, in this case you are responsible for setting up your notebook so that the TAs can reproduce your calculations at grading time (e.g., by including the appropriate install commands in one of the notebooks).\n",
    "   - Your intended audience is a typical student in this course. You may assume familiarity with all course material, but do not assume any prerequisites beyond those required for this course.\n",
    "   - You should be presenting material that has not already been presented in class.\n",
    "   - You should include an appropriate balance of expository text, examples of functional code, and references for further information.\n",
    "   - You do *not* need to include any participation checks; if you do, your final notebooks should *fill these in* with working sample code.\n",
    "   - As always, cite all sources and collaborators.\n",
    "- Meet with your assigned group and have each person make a presentation based on their notebook (excluding the exercises).\n",
    "   - Use Zulip private messages to contact your group members; I recommend doing this right away.\n",
    "   - Let me know as soon as possible if you are unable to contact one of the members of your group. If your group size drops below 2 because the other members drop the class, let me know and I will merge your group into another one.\n",
    "   - Your group can choose any mutually agreeable time(s) for the presentations as long as you get them done in time to submit the project.\n",
    "   - Your group may choose to meet in person or remotely, but you *must* accommodate any members of your group that wish to meet remotely.\n",
    "   - You are strongly encouraged to share your notebooks with the students in your group before your presentation, so that they can follow along as they would during a lecture. You can do this by transferring files through the shared project (each group has a designated workspace folder for this purpose); creating a new project with your group members as the collaborators; or downloading and uploading files out of CoCalc. (Reminder: you can attach files to Zulip messages.)\n",
    "   - It is permitted to revise your notebooks after making your presentation; in this case, please submit an extra file summarizing these changes.\n",
    "- Submit, in this folder, the following files.\n",
    "   - `presentation1-xxx.ipynb`, `presentation2-xxx.ipynb`: your presentation notebooks. Please specify the correct kernel in each notebook (and set it accordingly).\n",
    "   - `changes-xxx.txt` (optional): a description of any changes you made to your presentation based on feedback from your group.\n",
    "   - `feedback-xxx-yyy.txt`: for each other member of your group, your comments on their presentation. Here `yyy` is the other person's UCSD email address, again without `@ucsd.edu`. (So if your group consists of 3 people, you will submit 2 files of this type.)\n"
